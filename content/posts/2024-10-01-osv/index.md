Sharing this amazing event that I organized with an incredible team (the 2024 edition, the OrgSec Village has some other past editions as well). 3 half days with 2 simultaneous tracks and more than 130 participants!

> This third edition of Internews’ OrgSec Village brought together over 130 participants from more than 50 countries, representing more than 60 organizations operating at local, regional, and global levels. Experts from diverse fields, including digital security, human rights, and media, engaged in sessions on timely and pressing topics such as AI’s impact on organizational security, the rise of deep fakes threatening women’s safety, and strategies for maintaining information flow during internet shutdowns
